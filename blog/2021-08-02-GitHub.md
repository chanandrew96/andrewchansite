You can append .png to the URL for the User's profile to get redirected to their avatar. You can add the query param size to specify a size smaller than the default of 460px wide (i.e. it won't allow larger than 460).

Examples:  
https://github.com/twbs.png  
https://github.com/npm.png?size=200  
https://github.com/github.png?size=40
